abstract: The ability to collect and store ever more massive databases has been accompanied
  by the need to process them efficiently.  In many cases, most observations have
  the same behavior, while a probable small proportion of these observations are abnormal.
  Detecting the latter, defined as outliers, is one of the major challenges for machine
  learning applications (e.g. in fraud detection or in predictive maintenance). In
  this paper, we propose a methodology addressing the problem of outlier detection,
  by learning a data-driven scoring function defined on the feature space which reflects
  the degree of abnormality of the observations. This scoring function is learnt through
  a well-designed binary classification problem whose empirical criterion takes the
  form of a two-sample linear rank statistics on which theoretical results are available.
  We illustrate our methodology with preliminary encouraging numerical experiments.
