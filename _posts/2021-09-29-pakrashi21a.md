abstract: In multi-label classification, a datapoint can be assigned to more than
  one class simultaneously. Input space transformation methods can be used to transform
  the input space so that classification algorithms can perform better. Although existing
  algorithms used in binary or multi-class classifications can be used with multi-label
  datasets, this leads to one transformation per label and hence is very costly. Also,
  considering each label independently ignores consideration of any label associations
  in the transformation process which is a missed opportunity. In this work, a new
  input space transformation algorithm, Multi-label Neighbourhood Component Analysis
  (ML-NCA), is proposed. ML-NCA performs one single linear transformation of the input
  space in a supervised fashion, that transforms to a space in which $k$ nearest-neighbour
  based algorithms are expected to perform well. ML-NCA considers all the labels together
  while finding the single transformation of the input space, therefore omitting the
  need for per-label transformations. This also implicitly takes advantage of label
  associations. An extensive set of experiments and detailed analysis demonstrate
  that the transformation found by ML-NCA is able to significantly improve the performance
  of multi-label-specific $k$ nearest neighbour algorithms.
