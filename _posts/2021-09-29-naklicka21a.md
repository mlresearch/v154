abstract: The number of rule-based classifiers specialized  for imbalanced data is
  quite small so far. In particular, there is no such classifier dedicated for multi-class
  imbalance data. Thus, in this work we considered two ways of extending BRACID, which
  is the effective algorithm for binary data. In the first approach, BRACID was used
  in the OVO ensemble along with modifications of the prediction aggregation strategy.
  The second approach modifies an induction of rules for multiple classes simultaneously,
  additionally combined with their post-pruning. Experiments showed that both approaches
  outperformed the baselines. Moreover, the second approach turned out to be better
  than OVO with respect to predictive results  and producing a smaller number of rules.
