abstract: Industry 4.0 and recent deep learning progress make it possible to solve
  problems that traditional methods could not. This is the case for anomaly detection
  that received a particular attention from the machine learning community, and resulted
  in a use of generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this work, we propose to
  use intermediate patches for the inference step, after a WGAN training procedure
  suitable for highly imbalanced datasets, to make the anomaly detection possible
  on full size Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) images. We therefore show that
  our technique can be used to support or replace actual industrial image processing
  algorithms, as well as to avoid a waste of time for industries.
