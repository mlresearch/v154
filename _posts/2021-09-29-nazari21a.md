abstract: 'Over the last two decades, several approaches have been proposed to tackle
  the class imbalance problem which is characterized by the inability of a learner
  to focus on a relevant but scarcely represented class. The generation of synthetic
  examples to oversample the training set and thus force the learner to focus on the
  important cases is one of such solutions. Recently, generative adversarial networks
  (GANs) started to be explored as an oversampling alternative due to their capability
  of generating samples from an implicit distribution. Still, data difficulty factors
  such as class overlap, data dimensionality or sample size, and were shown to also
  negatively impact the learners performance under an imbalance setting. The ability
  of GANs to deal with the imbalance problem and other data difficulty factors has
  not yet been assessed. The main goal of this paper is to understand how data difficulty
  factors impact the performance of GANs when they are used as an oversampling method.
  Namely, we study the performance of conditioned GANs (CGANs) in an image dataset
  with controlled levels of the following data difficulty factors: sample size, data
  dimensionality, class overlap and imbalance ratio. We show that CGANs are effective
  for tackling tasks with multiple data difficulty factors, exhibiting increased gains
  on the most difficult tasks.'
