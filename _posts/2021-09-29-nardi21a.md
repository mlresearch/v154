abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of anomaly detection in decentralised
  settings. We took inspiration from the current edge computing trend, pushing towards
  the development of decentralised ML algorithms, i.e., the devices that collected
  or generated data are in charge of collaborating to train the ML models without
  sharing raw data . The challenges connected to this scenario are (i) data distributions
  of local datasets might be different, (ii) data is very often unlabelled, and (iii)
  devices have limited computational resources. We address them by proposing an unsupervised
  ensemble method for decentralised anomaly detection where the base learners are
  lightweight autoencoders. We aim to investigate whether an ensemble of lightweight
  models trained in isolation on non-IID and unlabelled local data can compete with
  heavier models trained in centralised settings. In a task of multi-category anomaly
  detection, our results show that our method exploits the data imbalance successfully
  to make accurate predictions.
