abstract: Advanced synthetic data generators can model sensitive personal datasets
  by creating simulated samples of data with realistic correlation structures and
  distributions, but with a greatly reduced risk of identifying individuals. This
  has huge potential in medicine where sensitive patient data can be simulated and
  shared, enabling the development and robust validation of new AI technologies for
  diagnosis and disease management. However, even when massive ground truth datasets
  are available (such as UK-NHS databases which contain patient records in the order
  of millions) there is a high risk that biases still exist which are carried over
  to the data generators. For example, certain cohorts of patients may be under-represented
  due to cultural sensitivities amongst some communities, or due to institutionalised
  procedures in data collection. The under-representation of groups is one of the
  forms in which bias can manifest itself in machine learning, and it is the one we
  investigate in this work.These factors may also lead to structurally missing data
  or incorrect correlations and distributions which will be mirrored in the synthetic
  data generated from biased ground truth datasets. In this paper, we explore methods
  to improve synthetic data generators by using probabilistic methods to firstly identify
  the difficult to predict data samples in ground truth data, and then to boost these
  types of data when generating synthetic samples. The paper explores attempts to
  create synthetic data that contain more realistic distributions and that lead to
  predictive models with better performance.
